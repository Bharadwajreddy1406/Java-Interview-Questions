# 1. Difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions in Java

**Question:**  
What is the difference between a checked and an unchecked exception in Java?

**Answer:**  
Checked exceptions are exceptions that the Java compiler forces you to handle. They usually represent recoverable conditions that might happen during normal program execution, such as attempting to open a file that doesn’t exist. Unchecked exceptions (also called runtime exceptions) don’t have to be explicitly handled and typically signal programming errors or unexpected conditions, like dividing by zero.

**Usage Code Example:**
```java
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ExceptionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Checked Exception Example: FileReader (must be handled)
        try {
            FileReader reader = new FileReader("nonexistentfile.txt");
            reader.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught checked exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        // Unchecked Exception Example: Division by zero
        try {
            int a = 10, b = 0;
            int c = a / b;
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught unchecked exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
````

**Example Input/Output:**

- **Input:** Run the `main` method.
- **Output:**
    
    ```
    Caught checked exception: [Error message indicating file not found]
    Caught unchecked exception: / by zero
    ```
