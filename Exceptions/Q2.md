# 2. Purpose of the finally Block in Java

**Question:**  
What is the purpose of the finally block in Java and when is it used?

**Answer:**  
The finally block in Java guarantees that a specific block of code will execute regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught. It is primarily used for releasing resources like closing files or database connections.

**Usage Code Example:**
```java
public class FinallyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
            int result = 10 / 0;  // This will throw an exception
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Finally block executed: Resources released");
        }
    }
}
````

**Example Input/Output:**

- **Input:** Run the `main` method.
- **Output:**
    
    ```
    Inside try block
    Exception caught: / by zero
    Finally block executed: Resources released
    ```
