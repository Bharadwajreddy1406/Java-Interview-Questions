# LeetCode 124 ‚Äì Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

## üß† Problem Statement

Given a **non-empty binary tree**, find the **maximum path sum**.

A **path** is any sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes has an edge connecting them.  
A path **does not need to pass through the root**, but it must go **downward (parent to child)**, and it **can end at any node**.

---

## ‚úÖ Code (Java ‚Äì Post-order DFS)

```java
class Solution {

    public int helper(TreeNode root, int[] max) {
        if (root == null) return 0;

        int lv = Math.max(0, helper(root.left, max));   // Left gain (ignore negative)
        int rv = Math.max(0, helper(root.right, max));  // Right gain (ignore negative)

        max[0] = Math.max(max[0], lv + rv + root.val);  // Path through current node

        return Math.max(lv, rv) + root.val; // Max gain to pass to parent
    }

    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        int[] max = new int[]{Integer.MIN_VALUE}; 
        helper(root, max);
        return max[0];
    }
}

## üîç Intuition

- We want to **maximize the sum** of any path, even if it doesn‚Äôt pass through the root.
    
- At each node, we compute:
    
    - Max path **through that node**: `left gain + right gain + node.val`
        
    - Max path **upward to parent**: `max(left, right) + node.val`
        
- We discard negative gains (use `Math.max(0, ...)`), as they reduce the total sum.
    

---

## üí° Notes

- `max[0]` holds the **maximum path sum found so far**.
    
- We compute the **maximum gain** we can contribute to the parent from each child node.
    
- The path can be:
    
    - Entirely on the left subtree
        
    - Entirely on the right subtree
        
    - Or cross the current node (left + root + right)

## üßÆ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time:** O(n) ‚Äì Visit every node once.
    
- **Space:** O(h) ‚Äì Recursion stack, where `h` is the height of the tree.

   / \
  2   3
Output: 6
Explanation: Path = 2 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 3

Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Tree:
       -10
       /  \
      9   20
          / \
         15  7
Output: 42
Explanation: Path = 15 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 7

Input: [2,-1]
Output: 2
```

## üìå Your Notes

> The clever trick here is:
> 
> - Use **post-order traversal** to gather gains from children.
>     
> - Choose 0 instead of negative values using `Math.max(0, ...)`.
>     
> - Always update the global max with **left + right + root**.
>     

This is a classic example of **DFS + global tracking** pattern, often used in path-based tree problems.
