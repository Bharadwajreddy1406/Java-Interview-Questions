## 💡 Problem
Given a string `s`, return the number of **homogenous substrings** of `s`.

A string is homogenous if all characters of the string are the same.

Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo 10^9 + 7**.

## 🧪 Example

### Input:
```txt
s = "abbcccaa"
````

### Output:

```txt
13
```

### Explanation:

- "a" occurs 2 times → contributes 1 + 1 = 2 substrings
    
- "bb" → 1 + 2 = 3
    
- "ccc" → 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
    
- "a" → 1
    

Total = 2 + 3 + 6 + 2 = **13**

## ⚙️ Logic

I did that logic where for **each streak of same characters**, you count how many substrings can be formed:

If a character repeats `k` times, it contributes:

k+(k−1)+(k−2)+...+1=(k∗(k+1))/2k + (k-1) + (k-2) + ... + 1 = (k * (k + 1)) / 2

But instead of storing and calculating each time, the trick here is to update a running `count`:

- If the current character is same as previous: `count++`
    
- Else: reset `count = 1`
    
- Add `count` to result at each step
    

This way, the result builds up **live** while iterating.

## 🧾 Approach

- Use a loop to go through the string
    
- Track how long the current homogenous sequence is using a `count` variable
    
- Add `count` to result every time
    
- Use modulo 1e9+7 to avoid overflow

## 🧑‍💻 Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int countHomogenous(String s) {
        int mod = 1_000_000_007;
        int count = 0;
        long res = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (i > 0 && s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i - 1)) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count = 1;
            }
            res = (res + count) % mod;
        }

        return (int) res;
    }
}
```

## ⏱️ Complexity

- **Time:** O(n)
    
- **Space:** O(1)

## 🧠 Reflections

I did that greedy style counting inside the loop rather than saving up chunks and calculating later.  
Felt good to see that instead of breaking it into groups, I could just update count and result on the fly.

One of those string problems that look harder until you realize **counting is the key** — just track how long the homogenous stretch is.
