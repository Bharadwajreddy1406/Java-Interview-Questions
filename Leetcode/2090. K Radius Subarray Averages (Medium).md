## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. The **k-radius average** for a subarray centered at index `i` is the average of all elements in the subarray `[i-k, i-k+1, ..., i, ..., i+k-1, i+k]`.  
If there are not enough elements on either side of `i` to form a complete `2*k + 1` window, set `ans[i]` to `-1`.

Return an array `ans` where `ans[i]` is the k-radius average for the subarray centered at `i`, or `-1` if it cannot be computed.

### Example 1:
#### **Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [7,4,3,9,1,8,5,2,6], k = 3
````

#### **Output:**

```plaintext
[-1,-1,-1,5,4,4,-1,-1,-1]
```

#### **Explanation:**

- For `i = 3`, the window is `[7,4,3,9,1,8,5]` → avg = `(7+4+3+9+1+8+5) / 7 = 5`
- For `i = 4`, the window is `[4,3,9,1,8,5,2]` → avg = `(4+3+9+1+8+5+2) / 7 = 4`
- For `i = 5`, the window is `[3,9,1,8,5,2,6]` → avg = `(3+9+1+8+5+2+6) / 7 = 4`
- Other indices do not have enough elements on both sides.

## Intuition

This problem is solved using a **sliding window** approach with a **radially centered window**. The idea is simple:

1. **Initialize the First Window:**
    
    - Run a loop from `0` to `2*k + 1` to sum the elements of the first valid window.
    - Place this sum's average in `ans[k]`, as `k` is the center of this first window.
2. **Slide the Window:**
    
    - Start a new loop from `i = 2*k+1` to `n`, where `i` acts as the right pointer.
    - In each step:
        - Subtract the first element of the previous window (`nums[i - (2*k+1)]`).
        - Add the new rightmost element (`nums[i]`).
        - Compute the new average and place it at `ans[i - k]`.

This ensures an efficient **O(n) time complexity**, as we are updating the sum in constant time.

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] getAverages(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (k <= 0) {
            return nums;
        }
        
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(ans, -1);
        
        if (2 * k + 1 > n) {
            return ans;
        }

        long sum = 0;  
    
        for (int i = 0; i < (2 * k + 1); i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
        }
        ans[k] = (int) (sum / (2 * k + 1)); 
        // running the first step and assigning the value

        for (int i = (2 * k + 1); i < n; i++) {
            sum = sum - nums[i - (2 * k + 1)] + nums[i];  
            ans[i - k] = (int) (sum / (2 * k + 1));
        }
        // running the second step and getting the work done

        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, as each element is added and removed from the sum only once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, for storing the output array.
