# Leetcode 219 - Contains Duplicate II

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that:

- `nums[i] == nums[j]`
- `|i - j| <= k`

If no such pair exists, return `false`.

## Example Test Cases

**Test Case 1:**
```

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3 Output: true Explanation: The element 1 appears at indices 0 and 3, and the absolute difference between the indices is 3, which is <= k.

```

**Test Case 2:**
```

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1 Output: true Explanation: The element 1 appears at indices 2 and 3, and the absolute difference between the indices is 1, which is <= k.

```

**Test Case 3:**
```

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2 Output: false Explanation: No such pair exists.

## My First Thought Process

Initially, I considered using a sliding window with two pointers. I thought about iterating through the array, maintaining a window where the difference between the two pointers was less than or equal to `k`. 

### Plan:
1. Iterate through the array with a `right` pointer.
2. For each element, compare it with the element at the `left` pointer.
3. If they are equal and the difference between their indices is less than or equal to `k`, return `true`.
4. If the window size exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer ahead.
5. If no such pair is found, return `false`.

### My Code (First Attempt)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsNearbyDuplicate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        while (right < n) {
            if (right != left && nums[left] == nums[right] && Math.abs(right - left + 1) <= k) {
                return true;
            }

            if (right - left + 1 > k) left++;
            right++;
        }

        return false;
    }
}
````

### Why It Won't Work

This approach doesn't work because:

1. We are trying to use a sliding window of size `k`, but this isn't sufficient to guarantee the condition `|i - j| <= k` for duplicates. The window might move too far forward without considering smaller windows between duplicates.
    
2. The logic fails when the `left` pointer is advanced and skips valid pairs that are closer than `k` because we aren't tracking the indices of the duplicates effectively.
	
3. **Regular sliding window only takes care of consecutive number, but here we need to find elements which may not be consecutive**
---
## **Correct Approach: Using a HashSet**

The correct approach is to use a HashSet to track the elements that have been seen within the last `k` indices.

### Plan with HashSet:

1. Use a HashSet to store the elements in the current window.
    
2. Traverse the array and for each element:
    
    - If the element already exists in the set, it means the current element is a duplicate, and the condition `|i - j| <= k` is satisfied.
        
    - If the element is not in the set, add it to the set.
        
    - If the set size exceeds `k`, remove the element at the left of the window to maintain the window size.
        
3. If no duplicate is found after the traversal, return `false`.
    

### Code Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean containsNearbyDuplicate(int[] nums, int k) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (set.contains(nums[i])) {
                return true;
            }
            set.add(nums[i]);
            if (set.size() > k) {
                set.remove(nums[i - k]);
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Why This Works

- **Why HashSet works:** The HashSet efficiently tracks the unique elements in the sliding window. We maintain the window size by removing the element that is `k` steps behind the current index `i`. If any element is found in the set, it means that element appears again within the required range, and we return `true`.
    
- **Why this approach is correct:** This method ensures that we only check for duplicates within the window of size `k`. As we move through the array, we dynamically adjust the set to maintain the window size.
    

### When to Use This Approach

This sliding window approach using a HashSet is effective in scenarios where:

- You need to track the uniqueness of elements in a window of fixed size.
    
- You need an efficient way to check for duplicates within a specific distance in an array (like `|i - j| <= k`).
    
- You need to maintain a sliding window of elements while ensuring constant-time checks for duplicates.
    

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. We are iterating through the array once and performing constant-time operations (insertion and deletion) on the HashSet.
    
- **Space Complexity:** O(k), since the HashSet can contain at most `k` elements at any given time, which is the size of the sliding window.
    

## Conclusion

This HashSet-based approach is efficient because it uses constant time operations to check and update the sliding window while maintaining the required window size. It is a good solution for problems involving checking duplicates within a window of fixed size.
