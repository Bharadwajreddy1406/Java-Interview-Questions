# **Leetcode 40 - Combination Sum II**

### **Problem Statement**

Given a collection of candidate numbers (where each number may only be used **once**), return all unique combinations that sum up to a given target. The solution set **must not contain duplicate combinations**.

### **Approach**

We use **backtracking** to explore all possible subsets.

- Start from an index and iterate through the array.
    
- Try picking a number, backtrack, and explore further.
    
- Use **sorting** to group duplicates together.
    
- **Skip duplicate numbers** after the first occurrence to avoid redundant sets.
    

### **Skipping Duplicates - Why and How?**

Sorting ensures that **duplicates appear consecutively**. If we have already considered a number at a certain depth, picking the same number again in a new recursive call would only **reproduce the same combination**.

---

### **What Happens When We Don’t Skip?**

Given:

```plaintext
candidates = [1, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7], target = 8
```

### **Without Skipping Duplicates**

1. **First Recursive Call (`index = 0, pick first 1`)**
    
    - We explore all possibilities **starting with this `1`**.
        
    - Possible valid combinations:
        
        ```
        [1, 1, 6]
        [1, 2, 5]
        [1, 7]
        ```
        
    - The second `1` (at index `1`) is used naturally when needed.
        
2. **Second Recursive Call (`index = 1, pick second 1 separately`)**
    
    - This time, we pick `1` from `index = 1` **as a fresh start**.
        
    - We explore **next elements: `[2, 5, 6, 7]`**, meaning:
        
        ```
        [1, 6]
        [1, 2, 5]
        [1, 7]
        ```
        
    - But hold on—these were **already generated** in the first recursion when we started at `index = 0`!
        

So, the second `1` **doesn’t add new unique sequences**, it only **recreates** some of the sequences from before.

---

## **Why Skipping Works?**

If we **skip** the second `1`, then:

1. The first `1` (at index `0`) already explored **all possible combinations** including another `1`.
    
2. The second `1` (at index `1`) would only **recreate the same sets**.
    

Thus, skipping **ensures we don’t redo work**, and every combination is formed in a **single unique way**.

---

## **Final Takeaway**

- If we don’t skip, we generate some combinations **twice**, just from different starting positions.
    
- Skipping ensures each unique number **at a given depth** in recursion is considered only once, **avoiding unnecessary duplicate work**.
    

Skipping doesn’t remove valid solutions—it just prevents redundant ones!, #This_is_IMP_IN_this_question
### **Final Code**

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> combinationSum2(int[] candidates, int target) {
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        Arrays.sort(candidates);
        backtrack(ans, new ArrayList<>(), candidates, 0, target);
        return ans;
    }

    private void backtrack(List<List<Integer>> ans, List<Integer> curr, int[] arr, int index, int target) {
        if (target == 0) {
            ans.add(new ArrayList<>(curr));
            return;
        }

        for (int i = index; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (i > index && arr[i] == arr[i - 1]) continue; // Skip duplicates

            if (arr[i] > target) break; 

            curr.add(arr[i]);
            backtrack(ans, curr, arr, i + 1, target - arr[i]);
            curr.remove(curr.size() - 1);
        }
    }
}
```

### **Time & Space Complexity**

- **Time Complexity**: `O(2^N)`, since each element has two choices (pick or skip), leading to an exponential number of recursive calls.
    
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N)`, due to recursion depth and the space needed to store combinations.
