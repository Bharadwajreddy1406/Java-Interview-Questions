## **Problem Statement**

There are `n` cities, and they are labeled from `0` to `n-1`. Given an `n x n` adjacency matrix **graph**, where:

- `graph[i][j] = 1` means that the `i-th` and `j-th` cities are **directly connected**.
- `graph[i][j] = 0` means that they are **not directly connected**.

A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities.  
Your task is to determine the **total number of provinces** in the given graph.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: graph = [[1,1,0],
                [1,1,0],
                [0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two provinces: 
- First province: Cities 0 and 1.
- Second province: City 2 (it is isolated).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: graph = [[1,0,0],
                [0,1,0],
                [0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Each city is its own province.
```

## **Intuition**

The problem can be solved using **graph traversal techniques**, **BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search).**

1. Each city represents a **node** in the graph.
2. If `graph[i][j] = 1`, there is an **edge** between city `i` and city `j`.
3. Our goal is to find **connected components** (provinces).
4. We **iterate through all cities**:
    - If a city has not been visited, it means we found a new **province**.
    - We perform **BFS (or DFS)** to mark all connected cities as visited.
    - Increase the province count.

# Approach

okay, so loop form 0 to n and have a visited array.
start a BFS whenever you get a non-visited index.
in `bfs`, we do add the non visited `i th` element
into the queue, and mark it visited.

and we run a while loop until the queue is empty,
and then we poll it

`int node = q.poll()`

and run a loop from `0 to n` where we check `i` is not visited and `matrix[node][i] == 1`
we mark it visited and add the `i` to queue

## **Code (BFS Solution)**

```java
class Solution {
    public void func(int [][]graph, int a, boolean[] visited){
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        int n = graph.length;
        q.offer(a);
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
            int node = q.poll();

            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
                if(graph[node][i] == 1 && !visited[i]){
                    visited[i] = true;
                    q.offer(i);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public int findCircleNum(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int prov = 0;
        boolean [] visited = new boolean[n];
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(!visited[i]){
                visited[i] = true;
                func(graph, i, visited);
                prov++;
            }
        }

        return prov;
    }
}
```

## **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity:** **O(NÂ²)**
    - We traverse the entire `n x n` adjacency matrix once.
    - Each node is visited at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** **O(N)**
    - We use a `visited` array of size `N` to track visited nodes.
    - A queue is used in BFS, which at worst case holds `N` nodes.

## **Alternative Approach (DFS)**

You can also use **DFS** instead of BFS:

```java
class Solution {
    public void dfs(int[][] graph, boolean[] visited, int i) {
        visited[i] = true;
        for (int j = 0; j < graph.length; j++) {
            if (graph[i][j] == 1 && !visited[j]) {
                dfs(graph, visited, j);
            }
        }
    }

    public int findCircleNum(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        int provinces = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(graph, visited, i);
                provinces++;
            }
        }

        return provinces;
    }
}
```
