# 73. Set Matrix Zeroes â€“ BFS/Queue Explanation

## Problem Statement
Given an m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. This must be done in-place.

## Approach Overview
Your solution uses a BFS/queue method to handle the zero-setting process in two main phases:
1. **Collection Phase:** Identify and store the coordinates of all zeros in the matrix.
2. **Modification Phase:** Process each stored coordinate to set the entire row and column to 0.

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Collecting Zero Coordinates
- **Iteration:**  
  You iterate over each cell of the matrix using nested loops.
  
- **Condition Check:**  
  For every cell `(i, j)`, if `matrix[i][j] == 0`, you create an array containing the coordinates `[i, j]`.

- **Storing Coordinates:**  
  These coordinates are added to a queue. This way, you record all the positions that originally had a zero, ensuring later modifications do not affect the discovery process.

### 2. Processing the Queue
- **Queue Processing:**  
  While the queue is not empty, you dequeue an element to get the coordinate `[row, col]`.

- **Zeroing Out the Row:**  
  For the extracted `row`, you iterate over all columns and set each element in that row to 0.

- **Zeroing Out the Column:**  
  Similarly, for the extracted `col`, you iterate over all rows and set each element in that column to 0.

- **Result:**  
  After processing all the coordinates from the queue, every row and column that originally contained a 0 will be completely set to 0.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:**  
  - The initial matrix traversal takes O(m * n).  
  - For each found zero, you update an entire row and column, which could lead to extra work if many zeros are present.
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - O(k), where k is the number of zeros found in the matrix (stored in the queue).

## Observations
- **Pros:**  
  - The solution is straightforward and easy to understand.
  - Collecting zero coordinates before modifying the matrix prevents accidental propagation of zeros during the iteration.
- **Cons:**  
  - This method may repeatedly process the same rows/columns if there are multiple zeros, leading to redundant work.
  - It uses extra space proportional to the number of zeros.
