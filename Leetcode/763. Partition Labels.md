#### **Problem Statement:** Given a string `s`, we want to partition it into as many parts as possible such that each letter appears in at most one part. Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

**Example Test Cases:**

```text
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]

Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]
```

## **Approach Explanation**

### **Step 1: Store Last Occurrences**

- First, we iterate through `s` and store the **last occurrence index** of each character in a hashmap.
    
- This helps us determine the furthest point we must reach before finalizing a partition.
    

### **Step 2: Iterate and Expand Partitions**

- Start at index `i = 0`.
    
- Maintain two variables:
    
    - `start`: Marks the beginning of the current partition.
        
    - `end`: Initially set to the last occurrence of `s[i]`. This marks the possible end of the partition.
        
- Expand `end` whenever we encounter a character whose last occurrence is further ahead.
    
- Once `i` reaches `end`, it means we have a valid partition.
    
    - Add `(end - start + 1)` to the result list.
        
    - Move `start` to `i+1` for the next partition.
        

### **Step 3: Continue Until String is Processed**

- Repeat this process until the entire string is partitioned.

## **Stepwise Breakdown of the While Loop**

```java
while (i <= end) {
    end = Math.max(end, map.get(s.charAt(i)));
    i++;
}
```

- **First, `end` is initialized** with `map.get(s.charAt(i))`, which gives the last index where `s[i]` appears.
    
- **As we iterate**, if we find a character whose last occurrence is beyond the current `end`, we expand `end`.
    
- **Once `i` reaches `end`**, we finalize the partition and move to the next one.

## **Code**

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> partitionLabels(String s) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();

        // Step 1: Store the last occurrence index of each character
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            map.put(s.charAt(i), i);
        }

        int i = 0;
        while (i < s.length()) {
            int start = i;
            int end = map.get(s.charAt(i));

            // Expand the partition while ensuring all chars are fully covered
            while (i <= end) {
                end = Math.max(end, map.get(s.charAt(i)));
                i++;
            }

            list.add(end - start + 1);
        }
        return list;
    }
}
```

## **Complexity Analysis**

- **Building the last occurrence map:** `O(N)`
    
- **Iterating through `s` while expanding partitions:** `O(N)`
    
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(N)`
