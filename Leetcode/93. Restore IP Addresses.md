# LeetCode 93. Restore IP Addresses

**Link:** [LeetCode 93](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-ip-addresses/)

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given a string containing only digits, return all possible valid IP address combinations that can be formed by inserting dots `.` into the string.

---

## 🧪 Constraints

- 1 <= `s.length` <= 12
- Only digits `0-9` are allowed
- Each segment of the IP must be in the range [0, 255]
- No leading zeros unless the segment is "0"

---

## ✅ Code (Java – Backtracking)

```java
class Solution {

    public void backtrack(String s, int index, int n, List<String> path, List<String> ans) {
        if (index == n && path.size() == 4) {
            ans.add(String.join(".", path));
            return;
        }

        if (path.size() > 4) return;

        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            if (index + i > n) break;

            String sub = s.substring(index, index + i);
            if (valid(sub)) {
                path.add(sub);
                backtrack(s, index + i, n, path, ans);
                path.remove(path.size() - 1);
            }
        }
    }

    public boolean valid(String s) {
        int val = Integer.parseInt(s);
        if (s.length() > 1 && s.startsWith("0")) return false;
        return val >= 0 && val <= 255;
    }

    public List<String> restoreIpAddresses(String s) {
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(s, 0, s.length(), new ArrayList<>(), ans);
        return ans;
    }
}

## 🔍 Intuition

We are generating all possible valid IPs using backtracking.

- At each level, we take 1 to 3 digits (if valid), and move ahead.
    
- We keep track of the current segments in a `path`.
    
- When we reach the end of the string (`index == n`) and have exactly 4 segments → we add it to the result.
    
- Otherwise, we backtrack and try the next option.

## 🌳 Backtracking  Example (s = "25525511135")

```
Start → try "2"
      → try "25"
      → try "255" ✅ (valid)
        → try next "2"
           → try "25"
              → try "255" ✅
                 → try "1"
                    → try "11"
                       → try "135" ✅ → ["255.255.11.135"]
                    → try "111"
                       → try "35" ✅ → ["255.255.111.35"]
...
```

- The tree explores all partitions of 4 segments.
    
- Prunes paths if:
    
    - Length exceeds 4 segments
        
    - Substring not in [0–255] or has leading zero

## 🔁 Iterative Insight

This problem is best suited for **backtracking**, not purely iterative methods.  
You could simulate with 3 nested loops to fix 3 dots, but:

- You’d need lots of manual validation
    
- It’s harder to generalize and less readable
    

---

## 📦 Data Structures Used

- `List<String> path` – current IP segments
    
- `List<String> ans` – result list
    
- Simple recursion stack
    

---

## 🧮 Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
    
    - Because total combinations are limited due to the max input length (12)
        
    - Only around 2^12 states explored max
        
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) auxiliary
    
    - Ignoring the output list size
        
    - Stack depth: at most 4 recursive calls at a time
        

---

## 🧠 Edge Case

Input: `"0000"`  
Output: `["0.0.0.0"]`  
Why? All zeros are valid if they're individual and not like `"00"`.
